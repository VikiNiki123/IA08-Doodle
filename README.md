This is my doodle app, using the Andriod Studio. 

You will run the program by 'opening the app' and you should be able to draw right away with the default values set in the brush. To change the size, 
opacity, or the color of the brush, you can click on the corresponding button to select a new option for that. There is a clear button that will always 
clear your canvas and change your brush to the defualt setting.

I will mention a bug currently that will 'reset' the canvas when you engage in any buttons though the changes to your brush will still apply.
I don't know why, hopefully Friday will save me :(
