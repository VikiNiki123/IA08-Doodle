This is my doodle app, using the Andriod Studio. 

You will run the program by 'opening the app' and you should be able to draw right away with the default values set in the brush. To change the size, 
opacity, or the color of the brush, you can click on the corresponding button to select a new option for that. There is a clear button that will always 
clear your canvas and change your brush to the defualt setting.

With the new update, the pervious bug was fied and there is an undo button now, this button will allow the user to undo their strokes after their most
pervious line made, similar to a queue (first in, first out) line of logic. All the user has to do to work the button is by clicking the 'Undo' to erase
their most current mistake.
